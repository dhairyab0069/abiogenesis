# Abiogenesis Simulation

This project simulates the process of abiogenesis(from a layman's perspective) - the natural process by which life arises from non-living matter. The simulation focuses on modeling chemical reactions, molecular interactions, and evolutionary processes in a primordial soup environment.

## Project Architecture

This project uses a **modular, layered architecture** with elements of the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern**:

- **Presentation Layer (View/UI):**
  - JavaFX GUI classes (`Launcher`, `SimulationView`, `AminoAcidChainView`) handle user interaction and visualization.
- **Business Logic Layer (Simulation):**
  - Simulation logic (e.g., `PrimordialSoup`) manages the rules, state, and processes of the simulation.
- **Data/Model Layer:**
  - Classes like `Atom`, `Molecule`, `Position`, and `AminoAcidChainGenerator` represent the core data structures and utilities.

**Summary Table:**

| Layer         | Package/Files                        | Responsibility                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| GUI           | gui/Launcher, gui/SimulationView, gui/AminoAcidChainView | User interface, visualization, simulation selection |
| Simulation    | simulation/PrimordialSoup           | Simulation logic for molecules/environment     |
| Model         | model/Atom, model/Molecule, model/Position, model/AminoAcidChainGenerator | Data structures and utilities                  |
| Build/Config  | pom.xml, README.md, docs/           | Build, documentation, and configuration        |

**Classification:**
> The project is a **modular, layered application** with strong elements of the **MVC pattern**. This makes it robust, extensible, and easy to maintain or extend with new simulation types.
